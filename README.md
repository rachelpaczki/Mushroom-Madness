## Project Description: 
This project aims to develop a predictive classification model using different algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ___ to classify various attributes of mushrooms. Using the Mushroom dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, we will focus on predicting the edibility of mushrooms based on features that include cap shape, cap color, odor, habitat, and others.

## Research Questions:
Are certain mushroom characteristics (i.e. cap shape/color, odor, gill size, etc.) that indicate it is more likely that the mushroom is poisonous? 
Which of these characteristics is most notable in determining if a mushroom is poisonous or not?
Can we effectively predict if a mushroom is poisonous based on its outer appearances/textures?
Extra Credit**: Make a chatbox that allows you to know the probability of a mushroom being poisonous based on one of the characteristics.

## Datasets Used: 
For this project we decided to utilize data compiled by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, titled “Mushroom”, indicating different mushroom variables such as poisonous status, cap shape, color, gill size, and odor. All of these variables can allow us to predict different aspects of mushrooms.

## Visualization Ideas:
Confusion Matrix
Feature importance if using Logistic Regression or Random Forest model
Matplotlib chart of count (edible vs poisonous?)

## Programs Used:
Python Pandas/Matplotlib
js/html/css (maybe for chatbox)**
